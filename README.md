# SQL Data Warehouse Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and managing data in a Data Warehouse (DWH) using SQL. The analysis includes data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, as well as complex queries to derive insights from structured data.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Data Modeling**: Defines the schema for the data warehouse.
- **ETL Processing**: Handles data extraction, transformation, and loading operations.
- **Complex Queries**: Performs advanced SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.
- **Data Aggregation & Reporting**: Provides summary reports using SQL functions.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**
- **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**
- **Data Warehousing Concepts**

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/belalmohsen13/Sql_Dwhouse_analysis.git
   ```
2. Load the SQL scripts into your database environment.
3. Run the scripts to create tables, populate data, and perform analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Who is this for?
- **Data Analysts & Engineers** working on structured data management.
- **Students & Researchers** interested in learning SQL and data warehousing.
- **Anyone** looking to understand ETL processes and SQL-based data analysis.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL** â€“ For managing the database.
- **DBeaver / pgAdmin** â€“ For executing and managing SQL queries.
- **Python (Optional)** â€“ For advanced data manipulation.
